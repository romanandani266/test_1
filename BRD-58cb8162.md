# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. The proposed system aims to efficiently track product stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste, thereby enhancing the overall supply chain efficiency for PepsiCo and its retail partners.

### Key Benefits
- **Reduced Stock Shortages and Overstocking:** By implementing real-time inventory tracking and automated restocking alerts, the system is expected to reduce stock shortages and overstocking by 25%.
- **Improved Supply Chain Efficiency:** Streamlining inventory management processes will enhance supply chain operations, potentially increasing efficiency by 20%.
- **Better Sales Forecasting:** Sales trend analysis will improve forecasting accuracy by 15%, aiding in strategic decision-making.

### Business Objectives
- **Specific:** Develop a web-based inventory management system.
- **Measurable:** Achieve a 20% reduction in inventory-related issues within the first year.
- **Achievable:** Utilize existing technologies and platforms to ensure feasibility.
- **Relevant:** Align with PepsiCo's strategic goals of optimizing supply chain operations.
- **Time-bound:** Complete the project within 12 months from the start date.

## 2. Project Overview

### Background
Currently, PepsiCo's retail partners face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to inefficiencies such as stockouts and overstocking. Existing systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, necessitating a more robust solution.

### Problem Statement
The core problem is the lack of an efficient system to manage inventory levels, resulting in increased operational costs and decreased customer satisfaction due to stock discrepancies.

### Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a web-based Retail Inventory Management System that offers real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis.

### Project Scope

#### In-Scope
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Web-based user interface
- Role-based access control

#### Out-of-Scope
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting
- Mobile application development

### Key Stakeholders
- **Retail Partners:** End-users of the system.
- **PepsiCo Supply Chain Team:** Oversee system integration and usage.
- **Warehouse Managers:** Manage inventory operations.
- **IT Teams:** Responsible for system development and maintenance.
- **Management:** Provide strategic direction and approval.

## 3. Key Findings and Analysis

### Current State Analysis
The existing inventory management processes are manual and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies such as delayed restocking and inaccurate stock levels.

### Gap Analysis
The current system lacks real-time data and predictive analytics, which the proposed system will address by providing automated alerts and trend analysis.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1:** Enhance existing systems with additional features. Rejected due to high cost and complexity.
- **Alternative 2:** Outsource to a third-party solution. Rejected due to lack of customization and control.

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Inventory Tracking:** As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Restocking Alerts:** As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low so that I can reorder in time.
- **Sales Analysis:** As a supply chain analyst, I want to analyze sales trends so that I can forecast demand accurately.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** System should handle up to 10,000 transactions per minute.
- **Usability:** User-friendly interface with minimalistic design.
- **Scalability:** Support for future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Security:** Encrypted data storage and role-based access control.
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime with fault tolerance.
- **Maintainability:** Easy to update and maintain with minimal downtime.
- **Portability:** Compatible with major web browsers.

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform:** AWS Cloud hosting
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Integrations:** Interfaces with existing ERP systems
- **API Requirements:** RESTful APIs for data exchange
- **Security Requirements:** SSL encryption, two-factor authentication
- **Backup and Recovery:** Daily backups with a recovery time objective of 2 hours

## 5. Business Rules

- **Data Validation:** All inventory data must be validated for accuracy before entry.
- **User Permissions:** Access to system features is determined by user roles.
- **Workflow Rules:** Automated alerts are triggered when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.

## 6. Feasibility Analysis

### Technical Feasibility
The proposed solution is technically viable using existing technologies such as Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.

### Operational Feasibility
The system will integrate seamlessly with current operations, requiring minimal changes to existing processes.

### Financial Feasibility
The project is expected to deliver a positive ROI within two years by reducing inventory-related costs.

### Legal and Regulatory Feasibility
The system will comply with all relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

## 7. Risk Assessment

- **Technical Risk:** Potential integration issues with existing systems. **Mitigation:** Conduct thorough testing and use modular design.
- **Operational Risk:** Resistance to change from users. **Mitigation:** Provide comprehensive training and support.
- **Financial Risk:** Budget overruns. **Mitigation:** Implement strict budget controls and regular financial reviews.

## 8. Impact Analysis

The system will streamline inventory management processes, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. It will also provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
