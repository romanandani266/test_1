### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and alignment among all parties involved in the project.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System is designed to provide a web-based solution for tracking product stock levels, predicting restocking needs, and minimizing waste. The system will include features such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. The project will not cover advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Enable real-time tracking of inventory levels.
- Automate restocking alerts to prevent stock shortages and overstocking.
- Analyze sales trends to improve supply chain efficiency and sales forecasting.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory levels effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in increased waste and reduced profitability.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated notifications for restocking needs.
- Enhance sales forecasting through trend analysis.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year of implementation.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the web-based inventory management system.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.
- Measurable improvement in inventory management efficiency.
- Achievement of project objectives within the allocated budget and timeline.
