# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To reduce stock shortages and overstocking.
- To improve supply chain efficiency.
- To enhance sales forecasting accuracy.

### Problem Statement
Retail partners and the PepsiCo supply chain team face challenges in managing inventory levels effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current system lacks real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in suboptimal inventory management.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better inventory management.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application on AWS Cloud.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Development of a web-based inventory management system.
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis for inventory prediction.
- Role-based access control and encrypted data storage.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Deployment will be on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system requires an internet connection for real-time tracking.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
#### Use Case 1: Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- **User Story**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed decisions about restocking.

#### Use Case 2: Automated Restocking Alerts
- **User Story**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low so that I can reorder products in a timely manner.

#### Use Case 3: Sales Trend Analysis
- **User Story**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs and minimize waste.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to accommodate additional features.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

### Technical Requirements
