# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the ability to track stock levels and predict restocking needs.
- Minimize waste and improve supply chain efficiency.

### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting accuracy.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20%.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15%.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all target users.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes.
- Positive feedback from at least 80% of the target audience.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based user interface with a minimalistic dashboard.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system requires an internet connection for real-time tracking.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to improve inventory forecasting.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Use Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to illustrate data movement.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database for storing inventory data.
- **Management**: Implement data validation and backup procedures.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Provide wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map user interactions with the system.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design & Prototyping (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (8 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment & Training (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- Estimated Budget: $150,000
- Required Personnel: Project Manager, Developers, UI/UX Designers, QA Testers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in development due to resource constraints.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate additional resources if necessary.
- **Risk 2**: Security vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits.

### Change Management
- Define a formal process for handling scope changes, including impact analysis and approval procedures.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system is considered complete when all functional and non-functional requirements are met, and user acceptance testing (UAT) is successfully passed.

### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system meets performance benchmarks.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Usability Testing**: Gather feedback from target users to ensure ease of use.
