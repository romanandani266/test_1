# Project Requirements

### Recommendations for Improved Data Flow in the BRD

1. **Data Flow Clarity:**
   - **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Ensure that DFDs are included and clearly illustrate the flow of data between different components of the system. This should include data sources, data processing, data storage, and data output.
   - **Data Mapping:** Clearly map out how data moves from one system to another, especially when integrating with third-party systems like PepsiCo’s supply chain. This should include data entry points, processing nodes, and exit points.

2. **Data Security and Privacy:**
   - **Encryption Details:** Specify the encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) used for data at rest and in transit. Ensure that all sensitive data, including user credentials and inventory data, is encrypted.
   - **Access Control:** Define role-based access controls in detail, specifying which roles have access to which data and under what conditions.
   - **Data Anonymization:** Consider anonymizing data where possible to enhance privacy, especially when handling customer data.

3. **Efficiency and Performance:**
   - **Data Processing Efficiency:** Optimize data processing workflows to minimize latency. This includes efficient querying of the PostgreSQL database and minimizing data transfer between the frontend and backend.
   - **Caching Strategies:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce load times and improve system responsiveness.

4. **Compliance and Best Practices:**
   - **Data Retention and Deletion:** Clearly define the data retention policy, including timelines for data deletion and methods for secure data disposal.
   - **Audit Trails:** Implement comprehensive audit trails for data access and modifications to ensure accountability and traceability.

5. **Potential Bottlenecks:**
   - **API Performance:** Identify potential bottlenecks in API performance, especially during peak usage times. Consider load balancing and horizontal scaling to manage high traffic.
   - **Data Synchronization:** Address potential data synchronization issues between the inventory management system and third-party systems. Implement mechanisms for conflict resolution and data consistency.

6. **Integration Security:**
   - **Secure API Endpoints:** Ensure that all API endpoints are secured using HTTPS and require authentication tokens for access.
   - **Data Validation:** Implement robust data validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity when interacting with external systems.

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle. It ensures that all parties have a clear understanding of the system's objectives, scope, and requirements.

#### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system that tracks product stock levels, predicts restocking needs, and minimizes waste. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, will be considered. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

#### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

#### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a streamlined and secure platform for inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 30%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Inventory tracking accuracy should be above 95%.
- User adoption rate should reach 80% within the first six months.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- User Authentication & Management: User registration, login, role-based access control (Admin, Warehouse Manager, Retail Partner), secure JWT-based authentication, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Inventory Management: Product CRUD operations, displaying stock levels, handling low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- Reporting & Sales Analytics: Dashboard with sales trends, graphical reports, and the ability to generate sales reports.
- Integration with External Systems: Frontend consumption of backend APIs for data retrieval (e.g., inventory data, sales data).

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- Internet dependency for real-time tracking.
