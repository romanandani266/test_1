   - The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
   - Real-time updates should reflect in the system within 5 seconds.

2. **Usability**
   - The user interface should be minimalistic and easy to navigate.
   - Provide a dashboard that summarizes key metrics and alerts.

3. **Security**
   - Implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data.
   - All data should be stored in an encrypted format.

4. **Scalability**
   - The system should be able to scale to accommodate additional users and data volume.
   - Support for future integration with other supply chain systems.

5. **Reliability**
   - Ensure 99.9% uptime for the system.
   - Implement data backup and recovery procedures.
