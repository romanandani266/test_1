2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**
   - The system should automatically generate alerts when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
   - Alerts should be customizable based on product type and location.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**
   - The system should analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns.
   - Users should be able to generate reports on sales trends over customizable time periods.

4. **User Management**
   - Role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can access specific features.
   - Ability to add, modify, and remove user roles and permissions.
