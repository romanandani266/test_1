2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**
   - The system should automatically generate alerts when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
   - Alerts should be customizable based on product type and sales velocity.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**
   - The system must analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns.
   - Provide insights into peak sales periods and slow-moving products.

4. **User Management**
   - Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions.
   - Allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**
