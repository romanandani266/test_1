# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

The system is designed to support retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. It will be a web-based application developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React, hosted on AWS Cloud. The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To track product stock levels efficiently
- To predict restocking needs accurately
- To minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking
- To improve supply chain efficiency
- To enhance sales forecasting capabilities

### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficient supply chain operations. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in suboptimal inventory management.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a real-time inventory tracking system
- Develop automated alerts for restocking needs
- Analyze sales trends to improve forecasting
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking
- Enhance supply chain efficiency by 15%

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory tracking system
- Accurate and timely automated stock alert notifications
- Positive feedback from retail partners and supply chain team
- Measurable improvement in inventory management efficiency

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Web-based application interface
- Role-based access control and encrypted data storage

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting
- Mobile application development

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed within budget limitations for advanced analytics.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time tracking.
- The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
#### Use Case 1: Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- **Actors**: Warehouse Manager, Retail Partner
- **Description**: Users can view current stock levels in real-time.
- **User Story**: As a warehouse manager, I want to see real-time stock levels so that I can manage inventory efficiently.

#### Use Case 2: Automated Restocking Alerts
- **Actors**: Supply Chain Team
- **Description**: The system sends alerts when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
- **User Story**: As a supply chain team member, I want to receive alerts when stock is low so that I can initiate restocking.

#### Use Case 3: Sales Trend Analysis
- **Actors**: Retail Partner, Supply Chain Team
- **Description**: Users can analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.
- **User Story**: As a retail partner, I want to analyze sales trends to forecast inventory requirements.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and back to users.
- **Storage**: Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Management**: Data will be managed using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map user interactions with the system.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design & Prototyping (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (8 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment & Training (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $150,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Developers, UI/UX Designers, QA Testers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Potential Risks**: Delays in development, budget overruns, technical challenges
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Regular progress reviews, contingency budget, technical support

### Change Management
- **Process**: All scope changes must be approved by the project manager and stakeholders. Changes will be documented and assessed for impact on timeline and budget.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance
